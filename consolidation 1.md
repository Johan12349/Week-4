# Introduction 
Throughout this consolidation document I will try and explain why I believe I should get a B.

## Fail
My biggest fail this module has been time management and failing to keep up with every aspect of the course. The biggest factor regarding my falling behind comes from a difficulty with managing my weekly workload from all five of my courses, in addition to working 30 hours a week. I had been on track to at least get fairly close to caught up during this week but I had some rather pressing personal matters come up that got in the way of that. 
## Win
Despite these difficulties I did manage to submit a memorial for the assignment, which was a family site for five people. I would have gotten more done for the assignment had it not been for the matters discussed previously. In addition to this I also have been relatively involved in discussions on the class Discord server, and although I have not done much for annotations I have still been reading, even if only through quick skimming, all of the assigned readings. I also managed to keep up with the podcasts, finding the talks of the two guests so far quite interesting, especially Bill Caraher.
## Challenges
My challenges go hand in hand with my fail, in that I struggled to keep up with all of my school, work and personal life and ended up with this class falling behind. Since I fell behind I also found the trying to catch up to be incredibly overwhelming, having a rather slow up take on the process of filling out the memorial forms, however having completed one, hopefully the rest will go much quicker.
## Implications?
Being honest I am not quite sure what exactly is meant to be done for this section, however I will do my best while running with the understanding that what is meant is reflecting on what I have said and what it means for myself and the course as a whole. Honestly, in this regard I think the implications of what I have said show that while I struggled initially, I have already taken your feedback into account and have done my best to implement it. I also think that as I go forward in the course I will gradually pick up steam, so to speak, and as I do more, things will get easier and go a bit faster,
## Previous Feedback
In regards to previous feedback, you gave a general outline as to how to work through the week, and following that general advice I began to make headway. I plan to continue to follow this general weekly outline to stay on top of all of my schoolwork.

## Changes I'm making moving forward
I have already begun to implement changes regarding my general schedule and approach to not just this course but all of my classes. In addition I plan to focus on specific aspects of the weekly work to make things more manageable. I am also considering asking for slightly reduced work hours depending on how these next few weeks go.
